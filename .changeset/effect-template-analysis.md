Add case study documentation comparing best practices from effect-template

This changeset adds comprehensive documentation analyzing best practices from
ProverCoderAI/effect-template repository, identifying gaps in our current setup,
and providing prioritized recommendations for improvements.

Key findings include missing best practices like code duplication detection (jscpd),
ESLint complexity rules, VS Code settings, and test coverage thresholds.
