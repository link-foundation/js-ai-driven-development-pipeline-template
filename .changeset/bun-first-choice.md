Make Bun the primary runtime choice throughout the template

- Update all shebangs from `#!/usr/bin/env node` to `#!/usr/bin/env bun` in scripts, experiments, and case studies
- Update README.md to prioritize Bun in all sections (features, development, runtime support, package managers, scripts reference)
- Update examples to list Bun first
- Bun now described as "Primary runtime with highest performance" and "Primary choice" for package management
- Maintains full compatibility with Node.js and Deno
