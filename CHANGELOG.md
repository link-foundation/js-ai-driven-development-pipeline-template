- 0198aaa: Add case study documentation comparing best practices from effect-template

  This changeset adds comprehensive documentation analyzing best practices from
  ProverCoderAI/effect-template repository, identifying gaps in our current setup,
  and providing prioritized recommendations for improvements.

  Key findings include missing best practices like code duplication detection (jscpd),
  ESLint complexity rules, VS Code settings, and test coverage thresholds.

  - PR detection works for all release types
  - NPM badges are added correctly
