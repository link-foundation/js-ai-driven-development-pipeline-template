# Issue 228: requirements, research, and implementation plan

This single PR addresses parent issue #228 and all ten sub-issues, #218–#227.
The issue bodies, all issue comments, and all three PR comment endpoints were
read on 2026-10-10. The initial branch is based on main at `4973fc4`; the reported defects are present there. The root Deno lock already matches
package.json, as #220 states, so that part adds enforcement without regenerating
the lock. PR #229 initially has no reviews
or comments. No listed issue is deferred.

## Work checklist

- [x] Read parent, ten sub-issues, comments, contributing guidelines, recent PRs.
- [x] Search primary upstream documentation and downstream implementations.
- [x] Map each requirement and related occurrences across the repository.
- [x] Add minimal reproducing tests and save the failing baseline.
- [x] Fix workflow audit coverage and link input selection.
- [x] Fix release waits, package-manager diagnostics, and duplicate output.
- [x] Replace every silent test gate; enable full parallel Deno testing.
- [x] Fix shell fixtures, environment isolation, and working-directory mutation.
- [x] Validate install-script policy and jscpd configuration.
- [x] Add a patch changeset; run local checks before each implementation commit.
- [x] Run Node, Bun, full Deno, and read-only Deno; exercise CI-like environment.
- [x] Fetch/merge main, review the entire PR diff, and leave a clean working tree.
- [x] Update PR title/body and every closing reference; push only the issue branch.
- [x] Check fresh CI timestamps/SHA; preserve and investigate non-passing logs.
- [ ] Finish any background work, verify CI, and mark PR #229 ready.

## Primary sources and existing components

- [zizmor usage](https://docs.zizmor.sh/usage/) and
  [integrations](https://docs.zizmor.sh/integrations/): repository inputs cover
  workflows, local actions, and Dependabot; online audits need a GitHub token.
  Keep the existing pinned zizmor 1.30.1 and action rather than adding a scanner.
- [lychee path exclusions](https://lychee.cli.rs/recipes/excluding-paths/) and
  [CLI flags](https://lychee.cli.rs/guides/cli/): directory traversal respects
  ignore files, `--hidden` includes dot paths, and extensions filter inputs.
- [Deno testing](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/testing/) and
  [permissions](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/permissions/): `--parallel` runs
  test modules concurrently; permissions can be queried without making a fetch.
- [Deno configuration](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/deno_json/):
  frozen locks are another enforcement option. A cross-runtime metadata guard
  catches drift on Node and Bun too, before Deno starts resolving dependencies.
- [test-anywhere #149](https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere/issues/149):
  Deno's suite skip drops registration. Upgrading the framework alone does not
  fix the conditional tests. Reuse its consistently reported `it.skip` API.
- [Deno #35545](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/35545): an entry-point
  symlink resolves relative imports from the symlink directory. The CLI fixture
  reproduces this in Deno 2.9.6 and reports a named skip; Node and Bun execute it.
- [command-stream #219](https://github.com/link-foundation/command-stream/issues/219):
  the Deno CDN build has unsupported `createRequire` behavior. Its two real CDN
  integration tests report this reason after checking network permission first.
- [Deno #36996](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/36996): sync spawn merges
  environment; explicit blanking is the documented cross-runtime workaround.
- [npm install policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install/) and
  [approve-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-approve-scripts/):
  use npm's built-in named decisions; no install-policy dependency is necessary.
- [jscpd upstream](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd): the installed 5.4.0 binary's
  help/config parser supplies the authoritative `weak` mode behavior.
- [command-stream upstream](https://github.com/link-foundation/command-stream):
  capture retains live mirroring. Keep the existing executor and failure parser.
- [disk-space-saviour PR #32](https://github.com/link-foundation/disk-space-saviour/pull/32):
  reference implementation of visible skips, detector, env isolation, install
  policy, and workflow coverage. Adapt the helpers to this repository's fixtures.
- [hive-mind PR #2924](https://github.com/link-assistant/hive-mind/pull/2924):
  measured npm propagation tail and fake-clock tests. Existing injected sleep
  functions let this repository test a 25.5-minute wait instantly.

New runtime dependencies are unnecessary: existing test-anywhere and the
installed CI tools provide the needed APIs. The heuristic detector is deliberately
tested against this suite's source style; manual searches complement it for
multiline headers and dynamically loaded integrations.

## Validation and CI protocol

Save large outputs to logs and inspect relevant chunks (at most 1500 lines).
Retain reusable probes/codemods in `experiments/`. Use finite fixture sizes,
subprocess deadlines, and existing suite/job budgets. No publication is needed
to test the release changes.

For each pushed head, list the five latest branch runs with createdAt/headSha,
compare them to the latest commit, download every non-passing run under
`ci-logs/`, and identify exact failures by log line. Initial branch runs
38045043983 and 38045044177 both passed on `94e44d9`; most implementation
checks were skipped because that initial commit only contains task metadata.
Final validation must use the implementation SHA.

## Reproduction and local evidence

The focused regression tests were written before changing configuration or
scripts. The saved baseline has 145 tests, 38 failures, and no ignored tests.
The conditional-registration detector finds 58 silent gates in the original
suite and zero after conversion. To reproduce against the old tree, run the
new guard/regression tests with the original workflow/config/script files.

Full local runs use the same discovered 63 test files. Node 24 and Bun each pass
792 tests. Full-permission Deno registers the same 792, with 789 passes and three explicitly ignored tests:
the upstream Deno symlink failure and two unsupported command-stream CDN
integrations. There are no environment-gated suites or vacuous test passes.
Read-only Deno reports 606 passes and 186 ignored tests, each with its permission
reason.

The Deno fixture run sets CI=true and invalid GITHUB_BASE_SHA, GITHUB_BEFORE_SHA,
and GITHUB_AFTER_SHA values to reproduce runner environment leakage. It exposed
a second detector launcher that inherited those values; that launcher now blanks
all CI/GitHub fixture variables. Parametrized test registrations inside loops
were reviewed separately and converted along with ordinary test declarations.
The remaining Windows EPERM symlink case is probed before registration so it
reports a reason too. No repository-aging/utimes fixtures exist in this tree.

Real tooling validation: npm 11.19.0 installs the example without ignored-script
warnings; Vite builds successfully. The electron-winstaller lifecycle selects
the host's bundled 7-Zip, esbuild installs its platform binary, and macOS-only
fsevents rebuilds its native binding. All three have explicit named approvals,
including the optional fsevents entry absent from a Linux install. Authenticated
zizmor 1.30.1 regular and pedantic audits both report no findings. The pinned
actionlint Docker image (including shellcheck and pyflakes) exits successfully.
Lychee 0.24.2 dumps 15 inputs, includes .changeset Markdown, excludes installed
node_modules, retains every requested exclusion, and emits no empty-input warning.

The polling arithmetic is 2+4+8+16+50\*30 = 1530 seconds for 54 checks. The issue's
1500-second figure is a rounding mistake; both release polling and the immediate
smoke check plus 153 ten-second sleeps now span 25.5 minutes. Custom overrides
and terminal verification failure behavior remain covered by existing tests.

## Fresh CI fixture investigation

All five workflows ran on `b96f7d6` at 2026-10-10T10:55:17Z. Four passed.
The complete non-passing Checks and release run `38046587982` was preserved in
`ci-logs/checks-and-release-38046587982.log` (16,923 lines). Its three failures:

- Lines 15857–15864 (also 12773–12780 and 11526–11533): `bun install` creates
  an untracked `bun.lock`, so the package-manager test's checkout-wide
  no-warning assertion failed on all Bun platforms. The guard correctly warns;
  the test now uses isolated shipped inputs and retains unexpected-lock tests.
  `experiments/ci-lockfile-probe.mjs` reproduces the generated warning.
- Lines 11265–11317: Windows Bun's fake `gh` could not start (`ENOENT`).
  The fixture blanked uppercase PATH and populated mixed-case Path. Windows
  treats these as the same variable, and the child API chooses one. A minimal
  regression fails before the fix; every PATH alias now gets the same value.
- Lines 6340–6351: Deno/Windows reports `EBUSY` while removing the Changesets
  fixture after a 20-second child invocation. The fixture now uses async child
  execution, closes unused stdin, and unlinks the shared dependency junction
  before bounded cleanup. Windows CI verifies the actual platform behavior.

[Bun lockfile documentation](https://bun.com/docs/pm/lockfile) confirms automatic
lock generation; [Node child-process documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)
documents case-insensitive Windows environment keys and first-key selection.
The existing test/job time budgets remain unchanged.
